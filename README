* INTRODUCTION

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, before computers and networks were
widely available, people played war simulation games and role playing
games using maps based on a field of hexagons. As computers with
graphics became common these hexmap based games became less common.
With the wide availability of network services, these old games all
but died out.

There are still a few people who are nostalgic for those games.

The hexgame library is meant to provide a framework for developing
networked graphical versions of those games.

* A NOTE ON IMPLIMENTING COPYRIGHTED GAMES

All of those old games are still under copyright, so they cannot be

MAKING AVAILABLE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF COPYRIGHTED GAMES WITHOUT EXPRESS
PERMISSION OF THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS IS FORBIDDEN BY LAW AND SUBJECT TO
PROSECUTION.

Don't Do it.
